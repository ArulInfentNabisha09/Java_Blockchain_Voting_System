# EFFICIENT REDACTABLE BLOCKCHAIN VOTING SYSTEM

Allows certain data on the blockchain,like personal info, to be edited without breaking the rest of the chain. The public trapdoor lets authorized users make changessecurely and transparently. This system helps keep voting secure and private while allowing updates if needed.
<br>

Through a combination of cryptographic techniques andconsensus protocols, our framework provides a robust and efficient solution for secure and transparent voting processes. This trapdoor mechanism ensures that only authorized parties can access and modify the redacted data, maintaining data privacy and security. PRBFPT offers a practical and efficient solution for data redaction in blockchain systems, allowing for the selective removal of sensitive information without requiring costly consensus mechanisms or complex cryptographic operations.
