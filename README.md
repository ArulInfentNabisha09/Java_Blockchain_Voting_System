PRACTICAL REDACTABLE BLOCKCHAIN FRAMEWORK WITH A PUBLIC TRAPDOOR IN VOTING

PRBFPT incorporates a public trapdoor mechanism that enables authorized entities to 
selectively redact sensitive information from the blockchain while preserving the 
integrity and consistency of the ledger. Traditional blockchain-based voting systems 
face challenges in ensuring voter privacy while maintaining transparency and 
auditability. PRBFPT framework addresses these issues by introducing a public 
trapdoor mechanism that allows authorized entities to selectively redact sensitive 
information from the blockchain, such as voter identities, without compromising the 
integrity of the overall system. Through a combination of cryptographic techniques and 
consensus protocols, our framework provides a robust and efficient solution for secure 
and transparent voting processes. This trapdoor mechanism ensures that only authorized 
parties can access and modify the redacted data, maintaining data privacy and security. 
PRBFPT offers a practical and efficient solution for data redaction in blockchain 
systems, allowing for the selective removal of sensitive information without requiring 
costly consensus mechanisms or complex cryptographic operations. Despite allowing 
for data redaction, PRBFPT maintains the fundamental properties of blockchain 
integrity, including tamper resistance, transparency, and immutability.
